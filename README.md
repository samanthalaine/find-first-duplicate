# Day 2: Find First Duplicate

## Learning Goals

- Practice algorithmic problem solving

## Instructions

Given an Array, find the first duplicate value that occurs. If there are no
duplicates, return -1.

```txt
Input: [2, 1, 3, 3, 2]
Output: 3

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: -1
```

Use the language of your choosing. We've included starter files for some
languages where you can pseudocode, explain your solution and code.

## Before you start coding

1. Rewrite the problem in your own words
2. Validate that you understand the problem
3. Write your own test cases
4. Pseudocode
5. Code!

**_And remember, don't run our tests until you've passed your own!_**
